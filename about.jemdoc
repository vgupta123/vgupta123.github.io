= About Me

I will be soon joining [https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/ Cognitive Computation Group] at [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/ UPenn CIS] school to work with [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/ Prof. Dan Roth] as a PostDoctoral Researcher. Will also engage with [https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/ Penn NLP] and [https://priml.upenn.edu/ PRiML] (ML group). Consider joining [https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/ CCG] or [https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/ Penn NLP] as Ph.D. or MS student. My research interest are Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, particularly problems incorperating both fields.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [http://www.cs.utah.edu/ Kahlert School of Computing], [https://www.utah.edu/ University of Utah], where I was advised by [https://svivek.com/ Prof. Vivek Srikumar]. My Ph.D. committee involves Prof. Vivek Srikumar (UoU), Prof. Jeff Phillips (UoU), Prof. Ellen Riloff (UoU), Prof. William Wang (UCSB), Prof. Mohit Bansal (UNC). My PhD thesis is titled as "Inference and Reasoning for Semi-structured Tables". My dissertation can be found [https://vgupta123.github.io/docs/phd_thesis.pdf here]. My Ph.D. defence presentation is [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LDDvAdmiFGd8LCngV-NzUMsQhbLHPQlf0Ghh5xIMURc/edit?usp=sharing here]. I was also the member of the [https://nlp.cs.utah.edu/people/ Utah NLP Group], coordinator of the [http://datascience.utah.edu/club.html Utah Data Science Club] (part of [http://datascience.utah.edu Utah Data Science Center]), and involved with [http://datascience.utah.edu/seminar.html Utah Data Science Seminar] organization with [https://users.cs.utah.edu/~jeffp/ Prof. Jeff Phillips] and [https://users.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/ Prof. Aditya Bhaskara]. I also taught Graph Data Structure and ALgorithm to undergrad along with [https://users.cs.utah.edu/~parker/ Prof. Erin Parker] and [https://dkoptacs.github.io/ Prof. Daniel Kopta]. I was gracefully supported by [https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022/ Bloomberg Data Science Fellowship] 2021-2022 (extended till 2023) during my Ph.D.. I also explored topics in fair Machine Learning under the guidance of [http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/ Prof. Suresh Venkatasubramanian] during my Ph.D.. I also work closely with [https://imsure318.github.io/ Shuo Zhang] from Bloomberg AI as part of [https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022/ Bloomberg Data Science Fellow]. 
\n\n
Before that, I was a Research Fellow in the [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-natural-language-systems-and-applications/ Machine Learning, Natural Language Systems and Applications] group at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/ Microsoft Research India]. I work under the guidance of [http://www.prateekjain.org/ Dr Prateek Jain], [http://praneethnetrapalli.org/ Dr Praneeth Netrapalli], and [https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZBkUp20AAAAJ&hl=en Dr Nagarajan Natarajan] on problems related to machine learning and natural language processing. 
\n\n 
Previously, I was a student at [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/ IIT Kanpur] where I obtained my M. Tech and B. Tech (Dual Degree) in Computer Science in 2016. I worked on Hierarchal Product Classification and Text Document Representation with [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/k/Karnick:Harish Prof. Harish Karnick] for my master thesis. I have also closely worked under the guidance of [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/ Prof Piyush Rai] on the problem of diversity priors for latent variable models and efficient algorithms for multi-label learning. I was also the first coordinator of Special Interest Group Machine Learning ([https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sigml SIGML]) at IIT Kanpur.
\n \n
I am interested in natural language processing and machine learning, especially statistical and computational intricacies relevant to the use of machine learning. Mission: Make machine smarter !! Solve intelligence. Uses the best technique in Machine Learning to build powerful general-purpose algorithms. \n \n 
I have been fortunate to have been advised by smart people. They showed me the light when I was in the dark. In every step, they were there to guide me. They have left a significant mark in my life. \n
